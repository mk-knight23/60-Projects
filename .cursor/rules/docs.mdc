# Writing Docs Pages

Docs are **action-focused guides** with copy-paste prompts. Keep them short and scannable.

## Structure

Two types of content — keep them clearly separated:

1. **Sequential steps** (Step 1, Step 2...) — Must be followed in order
2. **Prompt examples** — Independent, pick and choose

```mdx
---
title: "Page Title"
---

# Page Title

[1-2 sentence intro. What this helps you do.]

## Step 1: Do First Thing

[Instructions or prompt]

## Step 2: Do Next Thing

[Instructions or prompt]

---

## Prompt Examples

These prompts are independent — use whichever ones you need or create your own.

### Specific Task

[Prompt in code block]

## Testing

1. Check X
2. Verify Y
```

## Writing Prompts

Prompts are the core of each guide. Make them copy-paste ready:

```
I want to [GOAL].

Please:
1. [SPECIFIC ACTION]
2. [SPECIFIC ACTION]

Follow @AGENTS.md for project patterns.
UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
```

- Use `[PLACEHOLDERS]` for user-specific values
- Include `@AGENTS.md` reference in prompts
- For UI prompts, add at the **end**: `UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt`
- For complex prompts, add tip: `> **Tip:** Switch Cursor to **Plan Mode** first`
- Use MCP tools in prompts when available (Stripe MCP, Supabase MCP, etc.)

## Don't

- Don't explain concepts — link to Learn section instead: `See [Topic](/docs/concepts/topic)`
- Don't write paragraphs — use bullets and prompts
- Don't duplicate info from AGENTS.md
- Don't add "why" explanations — focus on "how"
- Don't include setup for other features — link to their dedicated pages

## Do

- Start with the main prompt users need
- Add specific prompts for common variations
- End with Testing checklist
- Keep total page under 150 lines
- Use `> **Tip:**` for helpful hints
- **Use MCPs when available** — Prefer MCP tools over manual steps or dashboard navigation
- **Keep it short** — Just enough to get the user going; let prompts and MCPs do the heavy lifting
