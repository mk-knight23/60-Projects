# Introduction

Welcome to **Ghoststack** — the friction-free foundation for vibe coders who want to ship and get paid.

## You Already Vibe Code. Now Go Faster.

You know how to prompt AI. You can build UI in minutes. But every project hits the same wall: auth that breaks, payments that don't connect, integrations that eat your weekend.

The friction isn't in building features. It's in the infrastructure that sits between your idea and your first paying customer.

## What Ghoststack Solves

Ghoststack removes that friction. The integrations are wired. The auth works. The payments flow. Your AI already knows the codebase (thanks to `AGENTS.md`). You just build your product.

**What you get:**

- **Integrations that work together** — Auth, payments, email, database, AI streaming — tested and connected. No debugging at 2am.
- **Zero mental overhead** — No wondering "did I configure the webhook right?" The gotchas are pre-handled.
- **AI context included** — `AGENTS.md` tells your AI what's safe to edit, what's sensitive, and how everything connects. Better prompts, better code.
- **MCP server configs** — Your AI talks directly to Supabase, Stripe, and deployment services. Natural language infrastructure management.
- **Copy-paste prompts** — Battle-tested prompts for common tasks. Less context-switching, more shipping.

The boring infrastructure work is done. You focus on what makes your product unique — and what makes you money.

## Who is This For?

Builders who vibe code and want to get to revenue faster. Whether you're shipping your first SaaS or your fifth, Ghoststack eliminates the setup grind so you can focus on your product.

Works with [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), or any AI coding tool.

## Ready to Ship?

Start with **[Install Tools](/docs/setup/install)** to set up your environment, then **[Set Up Your Workspace](/docs/building/workspace-setup)** to get the app running locally.

From there, build your features, configure [payments](/docs/building/payments), and start charging customers.
