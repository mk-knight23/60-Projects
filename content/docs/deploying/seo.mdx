### Add Page Metadata

```
I want to add SEO metadata to my pages.

For my homepage:
- Title: [YOUR TITLE]
- Description: [YOUR DESCRIPTION - ~155 characters]
- Keywords: [OPTIONAL: key, words, here]

For my pricing page:
- Title: [YOUR TITLE]
- Description: [YOUR DESCRIPTION]

Please update the metadata in each page file.
Follow Next.js 14+ metadata patterns.
```

### Add OpenGraph Images

```
I want social media previews when my links are shared.

Please help me:
1. Create or add an OpenGraph image (1200x630px)
2. Add OpenGraph metadata to my pages
3. Test it works with a preview tool

I want the preview to show: [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WANT]
```

### Update Sitemap

```
I added new pages to my app: [LIST PAGES]

Please update app/sitemap.ts to include these pages.
```

### Add Schema Markup

```
I want to add structured data for better Google results.

My app is: [TYPE - e.g., "a SaaS tool", "an online course", "a newsletter"]

Please add appropriate schema.org markup to my pages.
This helps Google understand what my site is about.
```

### Submit to Google

```
My app is live at [YOUR URL].

Please guide me through:
1. Setting up Google Search Console
2. Submitting my sitemap
3. Requesting indexing

Make it simple — I haven't done this before.

## App Icons & Social Images

Next.js looks for these files in `app/` folder:
- `icon.png` — Favicon (32x32 or larger)
- `apple-icon.png` — iOS home screen (180x180)
- `opengraph-image.png` — Social sharing (1200x630)

### Prompt: Set Up App Icons

```
I want to set up proper icons for my app.

Please help me:
1. Check if icon.png, apple-icon.png exist in app/
2. Create or update opengraph-image.png for social sharing
3. Verify favicon shows in browser tab

My app name is [NAME] and brand color is [COLOR].
```
