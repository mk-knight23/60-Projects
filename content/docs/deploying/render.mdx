# Deploy to Render

Deploy your app to Render.

## What is Render?

[Render](https://render.com) is a cloud platform that hosts your app. It's simple, affordable, and connects to GitHub.

> **Why Render?** If you don't need long-running tasks, Vercel or other platforms work fine. We recommend Render because it's straightforward, supports long-running tasks (e.g. background jobs, data processing), and has an MCP server for debugging deployments directly from Cursor. Vercel is great, but not necessarily beginner-friendly.

## Setup

### 1. Create Render Account

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up (GitHub login recommended)

### 2. Enable Render MCP

The Render MCP lets your AI tool check logs, debug deployments, and manage services directly.

1. Create an API key from your [Account Settings](https://dashboard.render.com/settings#api-keys)

**Cursor:**
- Add your API key to `.cursor/mcp.json` (the Render config is pre-configured in `.cursor/mcp.example.json` — just add your API key)
- Verify in **Cursor Settings → MCP** that Render is active

**Claude Code:**

Option 1 — Use template:
```bash
# Copy template if you haven't already
cp -n .mcp.example.json .mcp.json
# Then edit .mcp.json and add your Render API key
```

Option 2 — Use CLI:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http render https://mcp.render.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_RENDER_API_KEY"
```

> **More details:** See [MCP Servers](/docs/concepts/mcps) for full setup instructions.

### 3. Create a new deployment 

1. In Render Dashboard, click **New** → **Web Service**
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Select your repository

> **Hint:** You can also create the deployment directly via the AI and Render MCP — see the "Prompt Templates" section below!


### 4. Configure Service

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Name | Your app name |
| Environment | Node |
| Build Command | `npm install && npm run build` |
| Start Command | `npm start` |

> **Not working?** If you've customized your build setup, ask the AI:
>
> ```
> Check my repo and tell me the correct Build Command and Start Command for deploying to Render.
> ```

### 5. Add Environment Variables

In Render → **Environment**, add all your variables from `.env.local`.

**Important**: Use **live** Stripe keys (pk_live_, sk_live_), not test keys.

> **Warning:** Never paste secret keys into AI prompts. Add them to Render's dashboard yourself.

### 6. Deploy

Click **Create Web Service**. First deploy takes a few minutes.

## Prompt Templates

These prompts use the Render MCP to interact with your deployment.

### Create Service via MCP

> **Note:** Render MCP cannot create free tier instances. You'll need a paid plan, or create manually via the dashboard.

```
Use the Render MCP to create a new web service for my app.

Repository: [YOUR GITHUB REPO URL]
Name: [YOUR APP NAME]

Check my repo for the correct build and start commands.
```

### Check Deploy Status

```
Use the Render MCP to check my recent deploys.

List the deploy history for my service and tell me:
1. Status of the latest deploy
2. Any errors or warnings
3. When it was last deployed

My service name is: [SERVICE NAME]
```

### Check Logs

```
Use the Render MCP to pull recent logs for my service.

Filter for error-level logs if possible.
Help me identify any issues.

My service name is: [SERVICE NAME]
```

### Check Service Metrics

```
Use the Render MCP to check performance metrics for my service.

Show me:
1. CPU and memory usage
2. Response times
3. Any concerning patterns

My service name is: [SERVICE NAME]
```

### Update Environment Variables

```
Use the Render MCP to update environment variables for my service.

I need to change: [DESCRIBE CHANGES]

My service name is: [SERVICE NAME]
```

## After Deploying

Update external services to use your Render URL. These need to be done manually — the MCPs don't support changing these settings.

### Stripe Webhook

If you haven't set up your production webhook yet, do it now. See [Production Webhook Setup](/docs/building/payments#production-webhook-setup) for details.

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → **Developers** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add Endpoint** (or edit existing)
3. URL: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
5. Copy the **Signing Secret**
6. Add `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Render → Environment

### Supabase Redirect URLs

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Set **Site URL** to: `https://your-app.onrender.com`
3. Add to **Redirect URLs**: `https://your-app.onrender.com/**`

## Custom Domain

See [Custom Domains](/docs/deploying/domains) for:
- Connecting your domain to Render
- Updating all services (Stripe, Supabase, Resend)
- Setting up email from your domain

## Costs

Render free tier includes:
- 750 hours/month (enough for one app)
- Spins down after inactivity (cold starts)

Paid plans start at $7/month for always-on service.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Deployment Issues

```
Use the Render MCP to help me debug my deployment.

The issue: [DESCRIBE WHAT'S NOT WORKING]

Please:
1. Check recent deploy logs for errors
2. Pull error-level logs from the running service
3. List all env vars the code expects (I'll verify they're set)

My service name is: [SERVICE NAME]
```

### App Not Responding

```
Use the Render MCP to check why my app isn't responding.

My service: [SERVICE NAME]
My URL: [YOUR RENDER URL]

Check:
1. Service status and recent deploys
2. Error logs
3. CPU/memory metrics (is it overloaded?)
```
