# Pre-Launch Checklist

Before going live, test your app end-to-end yourself. No prompt can replace actually clicking through your app as a real user would.

## Manual Testing Checklist

Run through these flows yourself:

- [ ] **Build passes** — Run `npm run build` locally, fix any errors (or use prompt, see below)
- [ ] **Sign up** — Create a new account, receive magic link, land on dashboard
- [ ] **Sign out / Sign in** — Log out, log back in, verify session works
- [ ] **Checkout** — Subscribe to a plan (use your 100% off test coupon)
- [ ] **Webhook** — After checkout, verify subscription appears in database
- [ ] **Settings** — Check subscription shows correctly, test "Manage Subscription" portal
- [ ] **Cancel** — Cancel subscription from portal, verify status updates
- [ ] **Protected routes** — Try accessing `/dashboard` logged out (should redirect)
- [ ] **Email** — Trigger any transactional emails, verify they arrive

### Tips for Faster Testing

- **Use a fresh browser profile or private browsing** — Avoids cached sessions confusing things
- **Keep Supabase dashboard open** — Watch the `users` and `subscriptions` tables update in real-time
- **Keep Stripe dashboard open** — Check webhook logs under Developers → Webhooks → Select endpoint → Recent deliveries
- **Test on mobile** — Resize browser or use actual phone to catch responsive issues

## Verification Prompts

These prompts can help catch things you might miss. Use them as a supplement to manual testing, not a replacement.

### Build & Code Check

```
Run a pre-deploy check:

1. Run npm run build and fix any errors
2. Run npm run lint and fix any issues
3. Flag any TODO comments that need addressing

Report what needs fixing.
```

### Database Audit

```
Use Supabase MCP to audit my database:

1. Check users and subscriptions tables exist with RLS enabled
2. Verify policies restrict users to their own data
3. Verify the on_auth_user_created trigger exists

Report any issues.
```

### Placeholder Content Search

```
Search for placeholder content I might have missed:

1. Look for "TODO", "FIXME", "placeholder", "example.com", "your-"
2. Check app/privacy/page.tsx and app/terms/page.tsx are customized
3. Check meta tags in app/layout.tsx
4. Look for Lorem ipsum or dummy text

List everything that needs updating.
```

### Security Check

```
Run a quick security audit:

1. Search for hardcoded API keys or secrets
2. Check no secrets use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
3. Verify protected routes check auth server-side
4. Use Supabase MCP to verify RLS is enabled

Flag any concerns.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Deploy Failed

```
My deployment to [Render/Vercel] failed.

Error: [PASTE ERROR FROM LOGS]

Help me understand and fix this.
```

### Works Locally, Broken in Production

```
My app works locally but [DESCRIBE ISSUE] in production.

Check for hardcoded localhost URLs and list all env vars the code expects.
I'll verify the env vars are set in my hosting platform myself.
```
