# Custom Domains

Use your own domain for your app.

## What You Need

1. A domain (e.g., `yourapp.com`)
2. Access to your domain's DNS settings
3. Your app deployed to Render (or other host)

## Where to Buy Domains

**Recommended:**  
- [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) — Simple UI, transparent pricing, free WHOIS privacy. Great for most users.

**Other popular options:**  
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com) — Large selection, lots of TLD options, and extras (hosting, site builders).
- [Cloudflare Registrar](https://domains.cloudflare.com/) — At-cost registration, straightforward DNS, good if you already use Cloudflare.
- [IONOS](https://www.ionos.com/domains) — Good domain + hosting bundles, fit for business sites.
- [Dynadot](https://www.dynadot.com) — Affordable, good for power users, offers bulk management.
- [Hover](https://www.hover.com) — Clean, no-frills experience, privacy included.
- [Domain.com](https://www.domain.com) — Solid provider with lots of extension choices.
- [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com) / [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com) — Best if you want domain + web hosting in one spot.


## Setup

### 1. Add Domain to Render

1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. Click **Settings** → **Custom Domains**
3. Add your domain

### 2. Update DNS

Render will give you DNS records to add. Typically:

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| CNAME | www | your-app.onrender.com |
| A or ALIAS | @ | Render's IP |

Add these in your domain registrar's DNS settings.

### 3. Wait for Propagation

DNS changes can take up to 48 hours (usually much faster).

### 4. HTTPS

Render automatically provisions an SSL certificate once DNS is verified.

## Prompt Templates

### Set Up Domain

```
I want to connect my domain [YOUR DOMAIN] to my Render app.

Please guide me through:
1. Adding the domain in Render
2. What DNS records to add
3. How to verify it's working
4. Enabling HTTPS

My domain registrar is [Namecheap/Cloudflare/GoDaddy/other].
```

### DNS Not Working

```
I added DNS records but my domain isn't working yet.

Domain: [YOUR DOMAIN]
Records I added: [LIST RECORDS]

Please help me check:
1. Are the records correct?
2. Has it propagated? (Check with a tool)
3. What else could be wrong?
```

### www vs non-www

```
I want [YOUR PREFERENCE: "www.mysite.com" or "mysite.com"] as my main domain.

Please help me:
1. Set up the redirect
2. Make sure both work
3. Update my app's NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
```

## After Domain Setup

Once your domain is live, update these services to use it:

### 1. Environment Variables

In Render → Environment, update:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` → `https://yourdomain.com`

### 2. Supabase URLs

In Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration:
- **Site URL** → `https://yourdomain.com`
- **Redirect URLs** → Add `https://yourdomain.com/**`

### 3. Stripe Webhook

Update your webhook to use your custom domain. If you haven't created one yet, see [Production Webhook Setup](/docs/building/payments#production-webhook-setup).

In Stripe → Developers → Webhooks:
1. Edit your webhook endpoint
2. Update URL to `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Copy the new signing secret → Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Render

### 4. Resend Domain

So emails come from `you@yourdomain.com` instead of `onboarding@resend.dev`:

1. In Resend → Domains → Add your domain
2. Add the DNS records they provide (SPF, DKIM)
3. Wait for verification
4. Update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` in Render

### 5. Supabase Auth Emails (Optional)

By default, Supabase sends magic link emails from their domain. To send from yours:

1. In Resend → SMTP → Generate credentials
2. In Supabase → Project Settings → Auth → SMTP Settings → Enable custom SMTP
3. Enter Resend SMTP credentials:
   - Host: `smtp.resend.com`
   - Port: `465`
   - Username: `resend`
   - Password: Your Resend API key

Now magic links come from your domain too.

### Prompt: Update All Configs

```
I just set up my custom domain [YOUR DOMAIN].

Please guide me through updating:
1. NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL in Render
2. Supabase Site URL and Redirect URLs
3. Stripe webhook URL
4. Resend domain verification
5. Supabase SMTP with Resend

Make sure nothing is pointing to the old render.com URL.
```
