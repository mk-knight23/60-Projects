# Data APIs (RapidAPI)

Add external data to your app — weather, finance, social media, and more.

> **See it in action:** Check out the [Twitter Profile Summarizer example](/docs/building/features#example-twitter-profile-summarizer).

## Why RapidAPI?

[RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com) is a marketplace with thousands of APIs. Instead of signing up for dozens of services and learning each one, you get:

- **One platform** for weather, finance, social, news, and more
- **Unified billing** — one subscription manages everything
- **MCP support** — Cursor can understand API schemas directly
- **Free tiers** — most APIs have free plans to start

> **Not required:** You can use any API directly — see [Using Other APIs](#using-other-apis) below.

---

## Setup

### Step 1: Find & Subscribe

1. Browse [rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com) for APIs you need
2. Test in their playground
3. Subscribe (many have free tiers)

### Step 2: Connect MCP

Most RapidAPI endpoints have an **MCP Playground** button:

**Cursor:**
1. Click **MCP Playground** on the API page
2. Copy the config
3. Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` (or use the Twitter example in `.cursor/mcp.example.json` as a template)
4. Verify in **Cursor Settings → MCP**

**Claude Code:**
1. Use the Twitter example in `.mcp.example.json` as a template, OR
2. See [MCP Servers](/docs/concepts/mcps#rapidapi-mcps) for CLI setup instructions

## Prompt Examples

These prompts are independent — use whichever ones fit your needs or create your own.

### Integrate RapidAPI

```
I subscribed to [API NAME] on RapidAPI for [PURPOSE].

The MCP is connected. Please:
1. Create a utility in lib/ to call this API
2. Use it in my feature
3. Handle errors gracefully

Use the MCP to understand the API endpoints and response format.
Follow @AGENTS.md patterns.
```

### No MCP Available

If MCP isn't working, copy info from RapidAPI:

```
I want to integrate [API NAME] from RapidAPI.

Code snippet from their docs:
[PASTE CODE SNIPPET]

Example response:
[PASTE EXAMPLE JSON]

Please:
1. Create a utility in lib/
2. Use RAPIDAPI_KEY from environment
3. Handle errors gracefully

Follow @AGENTS.md patterns.
```

### Display API Data

```
I have data from [API NAME] that returns [DESCRIBE DATA].

Create a component that:
1. Fetches and displays the data
2. Shows loading state
3. Handles errors

UI: daisyUI ONLY. @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
Follow @AGENTS.md patterns.
```

## Using Other APIs

Don't need RapidAPI? Use any API directly:

```
I want to integrate [API NAME] for [PURPOSE].

API endpoint: [URL]
Authentication: [How it works - API key header, query param, etc.]

Example response:
[PASTE EXAMPLE JSON FROM DOCS]

Please:
1. Create a utility in lib/[api-name].ts
2. Keep the API key server-side (not NEXT_PUBLIC_)
3. Handle errors gracefully

Follow @AGENTS.md patterns.
```

## Testing

1. Call your API route — verify data returns
2. Check error handling — test with invalid input
3. Monitor usage — check provider dashboard
