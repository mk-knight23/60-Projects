# Analytics (Plausible)

Track visitors without invading privacy.

## What is Plausible?

[Plausible](https://plausible.io) is privacy-friendly analytics. Unlike Google Analytics:
- No cookies
- GDPR compliant
- Simple dashboard
- Doesn't slow your site

**It's also a lot simpler to set up and use.**

## Setup

### 1. Create Plausible Account

1. Go to [plausible.io](https://plausible.io)
2. Sign up (30-day free trial, then $9/month)
3. Add your domain

### 2. Add to Environment

Add to `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=yourapp.com
```

That's it! The tracking is already set up in Ghoststack.

## Prompt Templates

### Add Event Tracking

```
@web https://plausible.io/docs/nextjs-integration

We use Plausible analytics (next-plausible). Find the key user actions on /, /pricing, and /dashboard pages and add event tracking for them.

Look for:
- CTA button clicks
- Plan selection
- Navigation to key pages
- Sign up / upgrade actions

Use the usePlausible hook pattern for client components.
```

### Track a Specific Event

```
@web https://plausible.io/docs/nextjs-integration

I want to track when users [DESCRIBE ACTION - e.g., "click the signup button", "complete checkout"].

Please add event tracking for this action. The event should be named [EVENT_NAME].

Pattern to follow:

import { usePlausible } from 'next-plausible'

export default function PlausibleButton() {
    const plausible = usePlausible()
    return (
        <button onClick={() => plausible('customEventName')}>
            Send
        </button>
    )
}
```

### Remove Analytics

```
I don't want to use Plausible analytics.

Please:
1. Remove the Plausible provider from the app
2. Remove the environment variable
3. Remove the package if not needed

Clean it up completely.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Testing Locally

Plausible doesn't track localhost by default. To test:

1. Deploy your app
2. Visit your site (not localhost)
3. Check Plausible dashboard — visitor should appear

### Verify Setup

```
I set up Plausible analytics but it's not working.

Please help me verify:
1. Check the code references NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN correctly
2. Is the Plausible provider in the layout?
3. Is my domain configured correctly in Plausible?

My domain is [YOUR DOMAIN]. I'll verify my .env.local value myself.
```

### Common Issues

- **No data showing**: Make sure you're not testing on localhost
- **Events not firing**: Check the browser console for errors
- **Wrong domain**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN` matches exactly what you added in Plausible
