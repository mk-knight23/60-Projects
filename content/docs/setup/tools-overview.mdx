# Tools We Will Use

Before we start building, let's understand the tools that make Ghoststack work. Don't worry if these are new to you — we'll guide you through installing each one.

## AI Code Editor

This boilerplate works with any AI coding tool that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol). If you don't have a preference yet, we recommend **Cursor** — it's the easiest to get started with.

### Cursor (Recommended for Beginners)

**Cursor** is a code editor with AI built right in — you describe what you want in plain English, and it writes the code for you. Think of it like having a coding assistant sitting next to you.

- Visual interface — click to open files, see changes highlighted
- Beginner-friendly — no terminal experience required
- MCP support — connect to Supabase, Stripe, and more

**Pricing:** Cursor has a free tier to try it out, but for serious projects you'll want [Cursor Pro](https://www.cursor.com/pricing) ($20/month). The free tier has limited AI requests.

### Claude Code (For Experienced Developers)

**Claude Code** is Anthropic's command-line AI coding tool. It uses the same powerful AI as Cursor but runs in your terminal.

If you prefer working in the terminal and already have development experience, Claude Code is an excellent choice. It has full MCP support and works great with this boilerplate.

**Note:** This documentation focuses on Cursor for step-by-step instructions. If you're using Claude Code, we assume you're comfortable with terminal workflows and can adapt the instructions accordingly. MCP setup for both tools is covered in [MCP Servers](/docs/concepts/mcps).

### Why Not Lovable, Bolt, or v0?

You might have seen **Lovable**, **Bolt.new**, or **v0** — tools where you describe an app and it generates it for you. They're impressive for quick demos, but have real limitations:

| | Cursor/Claude Code + Ghoststack | Lovable / Bolt / v0 |
|---|---|---|
| **Own your code** | Yes — it's on your computer | Locked in their platform |
| **Deploy anywhere** | Render, Vercel, anywhere | Limited options |
| **Full customization** | Change anything | Hit walls quickly |
| **Production-ready** | Auth, payments, database built-in | Often need to rebuild for production |
| **Learn as you go** | See real code, understand it | Black box — you don't know what's inside |
| **Cost at scale** | Pay for hosting only | Platform fees add up |

**The trade-off:** Those tools are faster for prototypes. But when you need real features (user accounts, payments, custom logic), you end up fighting the platform or starting over.

**With Ghoststack:** You own everything from day one. The AI writes production code, not prototypes. And you can deploy anywhere — no lock-in.

## Git & GitHub (Version Control)

**Git** tracks every change you make to your code. If something breaks, you can go back to a working version. Think of it like "undo" on steroids.

**GitHub** is where your code lives online. It's like Google Drive for code — you can access it from anywhere, share it with others, and it keeps your work safe.

Together, they let you:
- Save snapshots of your work
- Undo mistakes easily
- Deploy your app to the internet
- Collaborate with others (if you want to)

## Node.js (JavaScript Runtime)

**Node.js** lets your computer run JavaScript code. Your app is built with JavaScript (specifically TypeScript, which is JavaScript with extra safety features).

You won't interact with Node directly — it just needs to be installed for everything else to work.

## That's It!

Just four things:
1. **AI Code Editor** — Cursor (recommended) or Claude Code
2. **Git** — Tracks your changes
3. **GitHub** — Stores your code online
4. **Node.js** — Runs your app
