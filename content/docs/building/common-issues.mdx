# Common Issues

Quick fixes for problems you might hit.

## General Debug Prompt

When something's broken, use this:

```
Something isn't working.

Expected: [WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN]
Actual: [WHAT'S HAPPENING]
Error: [PASTE ERROR IF ANY]

Help me find and fix the root cause.
Use available MCPs if needed. 
```

## Authentication

| Issue | Likely Cause |
|-------|--------------|
| Magic link not arriving | Check spam, Supabase rate limit (4/hr free), or Resend not configured |
| Stuck after clicking link | Callback URL not in Supabase dashboard |
| User not in database | Trigger from `setup.sql` not created |

```
Auth isn't working. [DESCRIBE ISSUE]

Check the auth flow: login → callback → dashboard.
Use Supabase MCP to verify trigger exists and redirect URLs are set.
```

## Payments

| Issue | Likely Cause |
|-------|--------------|
| Checkout not working | Missing Stripe env vars or wrong Price ID |
| Webhooks not received | Wrong URL, or `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` not set |
| Subscription not showing | Webhook received but database not updated |

```
Payments aren't working. [DESCRIBE ISSUE]

Trace: checkout → Stripe → webhook → database → UI.
Use Stripe MCP to check webhook logs and product setup.
Use Supabase MCP to verify subscription was saved.
```

## Database

| Issue | Likely Cause |
|-------|--------------|
| Empty results | RLS policies blocking query |
| Can't connect | Wrong env vars or project paused |

```
Database query not working. [DESCRIBE ISSUE]

Use Supabase MCP to check:
1. Table exists
2. RLS policies are correct
3. Data is actually there
```

## Build & Deploy

| Issue | Likely Cause |
|-------|--------------|
| Module not found | Missing dependency or wrong import path |
| Works locally, fails on deploy | Env vars not set in hosting platform |
| Type errors | TypeScript mismatch, run `npm run build` locally first |

```
Build is failing.

Error: [PASTE ERROR]

Help me understand and fix it.
Use Rener MCP if needed eg to check configs or logs. 
```

## Error Pages

The boilerplate includes error handling pages:
- `app/error.tsx` — Shows when something crashes
- `app/not-found.tsx` — Shows for 404 pages

### Prompt: Customize Error Pages

```
Customize the error pages in my app.

Update app/error.tsx and app/not-found.tsx to:
- Match my app's branding
- Include a link back to home
- Show a friendly message

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
