# User Menu & Settings

Ghoststack includes a working user menu and settings page:

- **User menu** (in header) — settings link, sign out button
- **Settings page** (`app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`) — email display, subscription status, logout

Your job: extend with profile editing, avatar upload, or notification preferences as needed.
