# Landing Page

Next, lets build a great landing page. Ghoststack already includes a landing page template the AI can use as a starting point. Like the rest of the app, we will build it exclusively with daisyUI components.

## What You'll Get

- A fully fledged, high-converting landing page
- Clear messaging and strong calls to action
- Clean, professional design built entirely with daisyUI

## Main Prompt

Use this to customize the entire landing page for your product:

```
You are a senior SaaS conversion + frontend expert.

Framework: Next.js (App Router)  

File: app/page.tsx  

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt

Product:  
- What it does: [1–2 sentences]  
- Target audience: [WHO IT’S FOR]  
- Key features: [F1], [F2], [F3]  

Goal:  
Rewrite app/page.tsx into a high-converting landing page.

Requirements:  
- Use only daisyUI components  
- Mobile-first, clean SaaS look  
- Strong hero + clear value prop  
- Features, how it works, social proof, FAQ  
- Clear CTA repeated  

Copy:  
- Create all copy  
- Tone: [professional / playful / technical / friendly]  
- Benefit-driven, concise, skimmable  

Follow @AGENTS.md patterns.
```

> **Why `@web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt`?** This gives Cursor access to DaisyUI's documentation, so it generates accurate component code. For a permanent setup (or if you're using Claude Code), see [Set Up DaisyUI Docs for AI](/docs/building/styling#set-up-daisyui-docs-for-ai).

## Add Specific Elements
You can also prompt Cursor AI to add or change specific landing page sections — just describe what you want!  
Here are some examples:

### Add Social Proof

```
Add a social proof section to my landing page at app/page.tsx.

Include: [TESTIMONIALS / CUSTOMER LOGOS / USER STATS]

Place it after the hero section.

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
```

### Add FAQ Section

```
Add an FAQ section to app/page.tsx using DaisyUI collapse components.

Questions:
1. Q: [QUESTION] A: [ANSWER]
2. Q: [QUESTION] A: [ANSWER]
3. Q: [QUESTION] A: [ANSWER]

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
```

### Add How It Works

```
Add a "How It Works" section to app/page.tsx with 3 steps:
1. [STEP 1]
2. [STEP 2]
3. [STEP 3]

Use DaisyUI steps component or a simple numbered layout.

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
```

### Change Hero Style

```
Update the hero section in app/page.tsx.

Style: [centered with gradient / split layout with image / minimal with large text]

Keep the login/signup CTA button.

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
```

### Add Feature Cards

```
Add a features section to app/page.tsx with cards for:
1. [FEATURE]: [DESCRIPTION]
2. [FEATURE]: [DESCRIPTION]
3. [FEATURE]: [DESCRIPTION]

Use DaisyUI card components in a responsive grid.

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
```

### Update Pricing

The landing page includes a pricing section that pulls from `lib/plans.ts`.

```
Update my pricing plans in lib/plans.ts:
- [PLAN 1]: $[PRICE]/month - [FEATURES]
- [PLAN 2]: $[PRICE]/month - [FEATURES]

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
```

This automatically updates both the landing page and `/pricing` page.

## Testing

1. View on desktop and mobile
2. Check all links work
3. Test the main CTA button
4. Read through — does it make sense to someone new?
