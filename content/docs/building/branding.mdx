# Branding

Ghoststack ships with placeholder branding — "Ghoststack" name, default favicon, generic SEO metadata. Replace these with your brand before launching.

Your job: update the app name, generate a favicon/logo, and set SEO metadata.

## Main Prompt

Use this after you've built your landing page:

```
Update my app's branding throughout the codebase.

App name: [YOUR APP NAME]
Tagline: [SHORT DESCRIPTION]

Please update:
1. app/layout.tsx - metadata (title, description, openGraph)
2. components/header.tsx - logo/brand name
3. components/footer.tsx - copyright name

Reference my landing page (app/page.tsx) for context on what this app does.
Generate SEO-friendly title and description based on my product.

Follow @AGENTS.md patterns.
```

Create a simple, recognizable icon that works at small sizes.
Save as app/favicon.ico and app/icon.svg.
