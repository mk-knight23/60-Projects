# Header & Footer

Ghoststack includes a working header and footer:

- **Header** (`components/header.tsx`) — responsive nav, login state handling, mobile menu
- **Footer** (`components/footer.tsx`) — links, copyright, mobile-friendly

Your job: customize the links, add your logo, and adjust the layout to match your product.
