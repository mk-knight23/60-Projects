# Terms & Privacy

Ghoststack includes placeholder legal pages at `/privacy` and `/terms`. These need to be replaced with real policies before launching.

Your job: generate or write policies that match your app's data handling and business model.

> **Disclaimer:** This is not legal advice. The prompts generate templates only. Consult a lawyer before launching, especially for paid products or if handling sensitive data.

## Why You Need These

- **Required by law** — Most jurisdictions require privacy policies
- **Payment processors** — Stripe requires Terms of Service
- **App stores** — Apple/Google require privacy policies
- **User trust** — Shows you take data seriously

## Files

- `app/privacy/page.tsx` — Privacy policy
- `app/terms/page.tsx` — Terms of service

The boilerplate includes placeholders. Replace before launching.

## Prompt: Generate Privacy Policy

```
Generate a privacy policy for app/privacy/page.tsx.

App name: [YOUR APP NAME]
What it does: [DESCRIPTION]
Data collected: [e.g., email, name, payment info]
Third-party services: Supabase, Stripe, Resend, [OTHERS]

Include: data collection, usage, sharing, security, user rights, contact.
Use plain language.
```

## Prompt: Generate Terms of Service

```
Generate terms of service for app/terms/page.tsx.

App name: [YOUR APP NAME]
What it does: [DESCRIPTION]
Paid service: [YES/NO]

Include: acceptance, accounts, payments, prohibited uses, liability, termination.
Use plain language.
```

## Prompt: Add Cookie Banner

```
Add a cookie consent banner.

Create a component, add to layout, store consent in localStorage.
Link to privacy policy. Use DaisyUI components.

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
```

## Quick Option

Use a generator for the first draft:
- [Termly](https://termly.io/) — Free policy generator
- [iubenda](https://www.iubenda.com/) — GDPR-compliant

Then ask Cursor to format it for your app.

## Testing

1. Read both pages — do they describe what your app actually does?
2. Check contact email works
3. Verify links from footer work
