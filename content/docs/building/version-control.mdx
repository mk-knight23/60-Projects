# Version Control

Save your work and never lose code again. Yeah, it might seem boring, but trust me—there will come a day when you'll be glad you took version control seriously.

**New to Git?** Watch [Git Explained in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) for a quick overview.

## Why Version Control?

Git tracks every change you make. If something breaks, you can go back to when it worked. Think of it like "save points" in a video game.

**Rule:** Commit early, commit often. Every time you finish something that works, save it.

---

## Initial Setup

Set up version control for your project and push to GitHub.

### Using AI (Recommended)

```
Set up Git and push this project to GitHub.

1. Stage ALL current changes (including any modified/deleted files)
2. Commit with message "Initial commit"
3. Create a new private repo on GitHub called [YOUR-APP-NAME] using `gh repo create`
4. Push to GitHub
5. Confirm with `git status` that there are no uncommitted changes

Use the gh CLI for GitHub operations.
```

### Manual Way (GUI)

**Video:** [Using Git with Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM)

1. **Initialize:** Source Control tab (left sidebar) → **Initialize Repository**
2. **Commit:** Click **+** to stage all → Type `Initial commit` → Click **✓**
3. **Push:** Click **Publish Branch** → Choose Private or Public

---

## Daily Workflow

Every time you finish something that works:

### Using Cursor's GUI

1. Open Source Control tab (Cmd+Shift+G / Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. Review your changes
3. Stage the files you want to save (click **+**)
4. Write a short message describing what you did
5. Click **✓** to commit
6. Click **Sync** to push to GitHub

**Tip:** Click the ✨ sparkle button next to the message field — it uses AI to generate a commit message based on your changes.

### Good Commit Messages

Keep them short and descriptive:
- `Add login page`
- `Fix signup button`
- `Update pricing section`
- `Connect Stripe payments`


### Commit & Push My Changes
Or use Cursor to do everything for you:

```
Look at my changes in @Branch and:
1. Write a clear commit message summarizing what changed
2. Stage all files, commit, and push to GitHub
```

### Review My Changes
It's always a good practice to have Cursor review your code before committing: 

```
Before I commit, please review what I've changed.

Look at my uncommitted changes and tell me:
1. What files changed
2. Does anything look wrong?
3. Is there anything I shouldn't commit (like secrets)?
```
Alternatively, you can use the 'Find Issues' button in the Cursor Git section.

## Restoring Your Code

Sometimes things break and you need to go back. Here's how to use Cursor to help:

### Restore to Previous Version

1. Go to your repo on GitHub and find the commit you want to restore to (look at the commit history)
2. Copy the commit hash (the 7-character code like `a1b2c3d`)
3. Ask Cursor:

```
Reset my code to commit [PASTE COMMIT HASH].
Keep my current changes as uncommitted so I don't lose anything.
```

### Restore Specific Files Only

Don't want to reset everything? Restore just the files you need:

```
Restore only these files from commit [PASTE COMMIT HASH]:
- app/page.tsx
- components/header.tsx
```

### Find Where an Issue Was Introduced

```
Something is broken but I'm not sure when it broke.

[Describe problem]

Please help me:
1. Look at my recent commits
2. Compare them to find where the issue was introduced
3. Show me what changed in that commit
```

## The .gitignore File

The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files to ignore and never track. This keeps sensitive data and unnecessary files out of your repository.

**What's ignored by default:**
- `.env.local` — Your API keys and secrets
- `node_modules/` — Dependencies (they get reinstalled via `npm install`)
- `.next/` — Build files that get regenerated

**Why it matters:** Without `.gitignore`, you could accidentally push your API keys to GitHub. Anyone could see them. The boilerplate comes pre-configured so you don't have to think about it.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Push

```
I'm trying to push but getting an error.

Error: [PASTE ERROR]

Please help me fix this so I can save my code to GitHub.
```

### Accidentally Committed Something

```
I accidentally committed [FILE/SECRET/etc].

Please help me:
1. Remove it from git history
2. Make sure it's in .gitignore
3. Push the fix
```
