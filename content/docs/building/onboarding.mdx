# User Onboarding

Add a multi-step onboarding flow for new users. Guide them through setup and collect the info you need.

## Create the Onboarding Flow

Use the main prompt to create your onboarding. Customize the steps for your app.

> **Tip:** Switch Cursor to **Plan Mode** first — this lets you review the approach before the AI starts building.

```
Create a multi-step onboarding flow for new users.

My app: [DESCRIBE YOUR APP]

Steps:
1. Welcome — introduce the app
2. Profile — collect [NAME / COMPANY / ROLE]
3. Preferences — [LIST PREFERENCES]
4. Done — show success and go to dashboard

Requirements:
- Show after first login (check if onboarding_completed is false)
- Progress indicator (steps component or progress bar)
- Save data to user profile on completion
- Skip button that marks onboarding as complete
- Redirect to dashboard when done

Use Supabase MCP to add onboarding_completed boolean to users table if not yet existing.
Create at app/onboarding/page.tsx.
UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
```

**Want something simpler?** Use this instead:

```
Create a simple 2-step onboarding:

1. Welcome + collect display name
2. Quick feature highlights (3 bullet points)

Save name to users table, mark onboarding complete.
Redirect to dashboard after.

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt. Keep it minimal.
Use Supabase MCP if needed to check or update tables or RCPs. 
```

## Prompt Examples

These prompts are independent — use whichever ones you need or create your own.

### Modify Redirect Logic

```
Modify the onboarding redirect logic.

Current behavior: [DESCRIBE CURRENT]
New behavior: [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WANT]

For example:
- Change where the redirect check happens (middleware vs layout)
- Add conditions (only for certain user types)
- Change the redirect destination

Use the existing Supabase auth patterns.
Use Supabase MCP if needed to check or update tables or RCPs. 
```

### Customize Steps

```
Update my onboarding flow at app/onboarding/page.tsx.

Change the steps to:
1. [STEP 1]: [WHAT TO SHOW/COLLECT]
2. [STEP 2]: [WHAT TO SHOW/COLLECT]
3. [STEP 3]: [WHAT TO SHOW/COLLECT]

Keep the progress indicator and completion tracking.
UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt. Keep it minimal.
Use Supabase MCP if needed to check or update tables or RCPs. 
```

### Add Feature Tour

```
Add a feature tour/walkthrough after onboarding.

Highlight these features:
1. [FEATURE 1 - e.g., "Dashboard overview"]
2. [FEATURE 2 - e.g., "Create your first project"]
3. [FEATURE 3 - e.g., "Invite team members"]

Use tooltips or a modal-based tour.
Let users skip or dismiss.
Track tour_completed in users table.
UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt. Keep it minimal.
Use Supabase MCP if needed to check or update tables or RCPs. 
```

### Track Analytics

```
Track onboarding analytics:

1. Which step users drop off
2. Time spent on each step
3. Skip rate

Log events to [Plausible / console / Supabase table].
UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt. Keep it minimal.
Use Supabase MCP if needed to check or update tables or RCPs. 
```

## Testing

1. Create a new account (or reset onboarding_completed to false)
2. Verify redirect to onboarding after login
3. Complete each step — data should save
4. Click skip — should mark complete and redirect
5. Log in again — should go straight to dashboard
6. Check user record in Supabase has the saved data
