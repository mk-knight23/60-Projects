# Set Up Your Workspace

Get the Ghoststack code on your computer and running locally.

## Step 1: Get the Code

Choose the method that fits your comfort level:

### Option A: Using Cursor + AI (Easiest)

1. Open Cursor
2. **File → Open Folder** → Create a new folder for your app (e.g., `my-app`)
3. Open the folder
4. Use this prompt in Cursor:

```
Clone the Ghoststack repo into this folder and set it up for me.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                     
If directory is empty, run:                                                                                                        
gh repo clone d33j4ymk2/ghoststack .                                                                                               
git remote remove origin                                                                                                           
																																	
If directory is not empty, clone into temp subdirectory, move contents up, cleanup, and remove origin remote.                      
																																	
Then confirm it worked. 
```

### Option B: Download ZIP (No Terminal)

1. Go to [github.com/d33j4ymk2/ghoststack](https://github.com/d33j4ymk2/ghoststack)
2. Click **Code → Download ZIP**
3. Extract the ZIP and rename the folder to your app name
4. Open Cursor → **File → Open Folder** → select your folder

### Option C: Using Terminal (Developer)

```bash
gh auth status              # check you're logged in
cd ~/Documents              # or wherever you keep projects
gh repo clone d33j4ymk2/ghoststack your-app
cd your-app
git remote remove origin
cursor .
```

> **Tip:** Replace `your-app` with your actual app name. Run `gh auth login` if not authenticated.

## Step 2: Clean Up Docs

Choose one option:

### Option A: Remove Docs Completely

If you won't need a `/docs` section in your app:

```bash
rm -rf content/docs app/docs lib/source.ts source.config.ts .source
```


### Option B: Keep Docs (Clear Content)

If you want a `/docs` section for your own documentation:

**Using Cursor prompt:**

```
Clear all the Ghoststack documentation content but keep the docs system working.

1. Delete everything inside content/docs/
2. Create a minimal content/docs/index.mdx with frontmatter (title: "Documentation") and a simple welcome heading
3. Create content/docs/meta.json with just ["index"] in pages

Keep app/docs/, lib/source.ts, and source.config.ts intact.
```

**Or run manually:**

```bash
rm -rf content/docs/*
cat > content/docs/index.mdx << 'EOF'
---
title: Documentation
description: Welcome to the docs
---

# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation.
EOF
echo '{"title":"Docs","pages":["index"]}' > content/docs/meta.json
```

Your docs will be at [localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs). See [Create Docs](/docs/extras/add-docs) for how to add pages.

## Step 3: Create Config Files

Create your local config files from the examples:

**Using Cursor:**

```bash
cp -n .env.example .env.local
cp -n .cursor/mcp.example.json .cursor/mcp.json
```

**Using Claude Code:**

```bash
cp -n .env.example .env.local
cp -n .mcp.example.json .mcp.json
```

This creates:
- `.env.local` — Your environment variables (API keys, etc.)
- `.cursor/mcp.json` or `.mcp.json` — MCP server configuration

All files are in `.gitignore` since they contain sensitive values. If the files already exist, nothing happens.

> **Note:** You'll fill in the actual values later when setting up [Authentication](/docs/building/auth) and [Payments](/docs/building/payments). For full MCP setup instructions (including CLI alternative), see [MCP Servers](/docs/concepts/mcps).

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This downloads all the packages your app needs. Takes about a minute.

## Step 5: Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Step 6: Preview Your App

Open your browser and go to:

**[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

> **What's localhost?** When you run `npm run dev`, your computer becomes a mini web server. `localhost` is just your own computer — and `:3000` is the "door" (port) the app uses. It's only visible to you, not the internet.

You should see the Ghoststack landing page. 🎉

## What's Next?

Your app is running locally! Now:

1. **Set up version control** — [Next page](/docs/building/version-control)
2. **Start building** — [Customize your landing page](/docs/building/landing-page)

**Tip:** Both Cursor and Claude Code automatically read your project's conventions file (`AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`) with every prompt. Learn more in [AI Prompting](/docs/concepts/ai-prompting).

## Troubleshooting

### npm install fails

```
npm install is failing with errors.

Please help me:
1. Check the error message
2. Fix any issues
3. Try again

Here's the error: [PASTE ERROR]
```

### App won't start

```
npm run dev isn't working.

Error: [PASTE ERROR]

Please help me fix this.
```

### Port already in use

If you see "Port 3000 is already in use":

```
Something else is using port 3000.

Please help me either:
1. Find and stop what's using port 3000
2. Or run my app on a different port
```

### Can't see the page

If localhost:3000 shows nothing:
- Make sure `npm run dev` is still running in the terminal
- Check for errors in the terminal
- Try refreshing the browser
