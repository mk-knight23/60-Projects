# Translations (i18n)

Make your app available in multiple languages.

## What is i18n?

i18n (internationalization) means making your app work in different languages. Users see content in their preferred language.

## When You Need It

- Targeting users in multiple countries
- Growing internationally
- User requests for other languages

**Not yet?** Skip this until you need it. Adds complexity.

## Recommended: next-intl

[next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) is the recommended library for Next.js translations.

## Setup

### 1. Install Package

```bash
npm install next-intl
```

### 2. Create Translation Files
