# Create Docs

Add a documentation site to your app. Docs are powered by [fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev) — write MDX files and they appear at `/docs` automatically.

## Restore Docs (If Deleted)

If you removed the docs during setup, restore them from git:

```bash
git checkout HEAD -- content/docs app/docs lib/source.ts source.config.ts
```

Or use this prompt:

```
Restore the docs feature from git history.

Find the lastest commit that still had the docs feature and restore the docs setup. Dont restore other files!

E.g. git checkout HEAD -- content/docs app/docs lib/source.ts source.config.ts
```

Then run `npm run dev` and visit [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs).

## Prompt Examples

These prompts are independent — use whichever ones you need or create your own.

### Add a New Page

```
Create documentation for [FEATURE].

File: content/docs/[SECTION]/[FILENAME].mdx

Include:
- Frontmatter with title and description
- Overview of what it does
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples where helpful

Style: Clear, concise, scannable. Use headings, bullet points, code blocks.
```

### Add a New Section

```
Add a new docs section called "[SECTION NAME]".

1. Create folder: content/docs/[section-slug]/
2. Add meta.json with title and page order
3. Add the section to content/docs/meta.json
4. Create the first page: [PAGE NAME].mdx

Follow the existing docs structure.
```

### Reorder Navigation

```
Update the docs navigation in content/docs/meta.json.

New order:
1. [SECTION 1]
2. [SECTION 2]
3. [SECTION 3]

Use separators (---Title---) to group related sections.
```

### Match Docs Theme to Your App

The docs section uses fumadocs with its own CSS variables — **your app's daisyUI theme won't automatically apply here**. You need to adjust `app/docs/docs.css` separately.

1. Go to [DaisyUI Theme Generator](https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/)
2. Select your theme (or paste your custom theme)
3. Copy the color values (or click 'CSS' button to copy all)

```
Update app/docs/docs.css to match my app's daisyUI theme.

Colors from my theme:
- Primary: [HEX COLOR]
- Background: [HEX COLOR]
- Text/foreground: [HEX COLOR]

Convert to oklch format and update the fumadocs CSS variables.
Keep the existing structure, just update colors.

```

### Improve Existing Docs

```
Improve the documentation at content/docs/[PATH].mdx

Make it:
- Clearer and more concise
- Better organized with headings
- Include practical examples
- Add troubleshooting section if missing
```

## Testing

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs)
2. Check sidebar navigation shows your sections
3. Verify colors match your app's theme
