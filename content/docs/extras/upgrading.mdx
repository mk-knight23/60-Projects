# Upgrading Ghoststack

How to get updates from the Ghoststack boilerplate.

## How Upgrades Work

Ghoststack is a **starting point**, not a dependency. You own the code.

When we release updates:
- You can choose to incorporate them
- Your customizations won't be overwritten
- Pick and choose what you need

## Checking for Updates

### Prompt: Check for Updates

```
I want to check if there are updates to Ghoststack I should incorporate.

Please help me:
1. Compare my version to the latest
2. List what's changed
3. Identify which changes would be useful for me
4. Skip changes to files I've heavily customized

I want to be selective, not blindly update everything.
```

## Safe Update Areas

These are usually safe to update:

| File/Area | Why Safe |
|-----------|----------|
| `lib/` utilities | Core logic, usually unchanged by you |
| Dependencies | Bug fixes, security patches |
| API routes | Unless you've modified them |

## Risky Update Areas

Be careful with:

| File/Area | Why Risky |
|-----------|-----------|
| `app/page.tsx` | You've customized your landing page |
| Components | You've added your own styling |
| Database schema | You've added tables/columns |

## Prompt Templates

### Update Dependencies

```
I want to update my npm dependencies to latest versions.

Please:
1. Check for outdated packages
2. Update them safely
3. Run build to check for breaking changes
4. Fix any issues that arise

Be careful with major version bumps.
```

### Incorporate Specific Feature

```
Ghoststack added [NEW FEATURE] and I want to incorporate it.

Please:
1. Look at how it's implemented in the latest version
2. Add it to my codebase
3. Adapt it to work with my customizations
4. Test that it works

Don't overwrite my existing customizations.
```

### Review Changes

```
I want to review changes between my Ghoststack version and the latest.

Please compare:
- lib/ files
- app/api/ routes  
- Core components

List what's changed and recommend what I should update.
Skip files I've heavily customized.
```
