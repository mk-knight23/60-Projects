# Blog

Add a blog to your app for content marketing and SEO.

> **Tip:** Switch Cursor to **Plan Mode** first — this is a multi-file setup.

**How it works:** Blog posts are MDX files in `content/blog/`. Add new posts by creating files (or prompting AI to write them). No CMS — deploy to publish.

## Main Prompt

```
I want to add a blog to my app.

Please create:
1. Blog listing page at app/blog/page.tsx
2. Dynamic post page at app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
3. Content folder at content/blog/
4. A sample blog post

Requirements:
- Use MDX for blog posts
- Frontmatter: title, date, description, author
- Blog listing shows title, date, excerpt
- Individual posts render full MDX
- Add proper SEO metadata
- Add "Blog" link to header navigation

Install any needed packages (gray-matter, next-mdx-remote or similar).
Follow @AGENTS.md patterns.
