# Waitlist / Coming Soon

Collect emails before your product is ready. Replace your landing page with a simple waitlist.

> **Requires:** [Supabase setup](/docs/setup/install) to store emails. [Resend setup](/docs/building/email) if sending confirmation emails.

---

## Prompt Examples

These prompts are independent — use whichever ones you need or create your own.

### Create Waitlist Page

```
I want to replace my landing page with a waitlist/coming soon page.

My app:
- Name: [YOUR APP NAME]
- What it does: [ONE SENTENCE]
- Launch date: [APPROXIMATE DATE or "soon"]

Please:
1. Replace app/page.tsx with a simple waitlist page
2. Create app/api/waitlist/route.ts to save emails
3. Use Supabase MCP to create the waitlist table with RLS
4. Show success/error messages

The page should have:
- Headline
- Brief description
- Email input
- Submit button
- "No spam" reassurance

UI: daisyUI ONLY (no custom CSS, no other libs). @web https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
```

### Add Waitlist Counter

```
I want to show how many people have joined the waitlist.

Please update my waitlist page to:
1. Query the count of emails in the waitlist table
2. Display it like "Join 127 others on the waitlist"

Keep it simple and use our existing patterns.
```

### Send Confirmation Email

```
I want to send a confirmation email when someone joins my waitlist.

Please update app/api/waitlist/route.ts to:
1. Save the email to the database
2. Send a confirmation email using lib/resend.ts
3. Handle errors gracefully

Email should thank them and tell them you'll notify them at launch.
```

### Export Waitlist Emails

```
I want to export my waitlist emails to send a launch announcement.

Use Supabase MCP to:
1. Query all emails from the waitlist table
2. Export them in a format I can use for email

Then guide me through sending the launch email with Resend.
```

### Convert to Full Site

```
My product is ready. I want to replace my waitlist with the full landing page.

Please:
1. Restore app/page.tsx to a proper landing page
2. Keep the waitlist table (I'll use it for the launch email)
3. Update for my product:
   - Name: [NAME]
   - Description: [DESCRIPTION]
   - Features: [FEATURES]

Use the standard landing page structure with DaisyUI.
```

## Testing

1. Submit your own email
2. Check it appears in Supabase
3. Verify the success message shows
4. Try submitting the same email again (should handle duplicates)
