# Affiliate Marketing

Let others promote your product and earn commission.

[Rewardful](https://www.rewardful.com) integrates directly with Stripe to create an affiliate program. Affiliates get unique links, and you automatically pay them a percentage of each sale.

## Why It Works

- **No upfront cost** — Only pay when you make money
- **Word-of-mouth** — Affiliates have audiences who trust them
- **Automatic tracking** — Rewardful handles attribution and payouts
