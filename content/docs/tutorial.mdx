## What is PostFuel?

PostFuel is a simple AI-powered tool that:

1. Uses Rapidapi to scrpe your X (Twitter) account
2. Analyzes your writing style and best-performing tweets
3. Uses AI (GPT 5.2 with websearch via openrouter) to generate personalized tweet ideas based on hot topics and news.
4. Sends you a daily email with fresh content suggestions

It's a perfect example of an AI micro SaaS — small, focused, and valuable.
