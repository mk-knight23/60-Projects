# Environment Variables (.env)

Environment variables store secrets and configuration that shouldn't be in your code.

## What's an .env File?

It's a simple text file with key-value pairs:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xyz.supabase.co
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_abc123
```

Your code reads these values at runtime. The actual secrets never end up in your codebase or on GitHub.

## Why Not Just Put Secrets in Code?

If you write `const apiKey = "sk_live_abc123"` directly in your code:
- Anyone who sees your code sees your secrets
- You'd push secrets to GitHub (bad)
- You can't have different values for dev vs production

## How Ghoststack Uses Them

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.env.example` | Template showing which variables you need (safe to commit) |
| `.env.local` | Your actual secrets (never committed, in `.gitignore`) |

When you deploy, you set these same variables in your hosting platform (Render, Vercel, etc).

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Copy the template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit with your real values
# .env.local is ignored by git — your secrets stay local
```

## Secret Keys and AI Prompts

> **Warning:** Never paste secret keys into AI prompts.

Cursor (and other AI tools) **cannot read your `.env.local` file** — it's excluded for security. This is intentional.

**Safe to mention in prompts:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables (these are public by design)
- Variable *names* (e.g., "uses STRIPE_SECRET_KEY")
- Whether a variable is set (you check manually)

**Never paste into prompts:**
- Actual secret key values (`sk_live_...`, `whsec_...`, etc.)
- Service role keys, webhook secrets, API keys

If an AI asks for your secret key value, don't provide it. Instead, confirm you've set it in `.env.local` yourself.

**Rule:** Never commit `.env.local`. The `.gitignore` already handles this, so you don't have to think about it.
