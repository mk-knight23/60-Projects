# Design Philosophy

How Ghoststack is built and why it matters for vibe coding.

## Built for AI Coding

Ghoststack is designed to be edited by AI (Cursor, Claude). This means:

- **Simple structure** — Easy for AI to understand
- **Self-contained files** — No chasing dependencies
- **Consistent patterns** — Same approach everywhere
- **Clear naming** — Files named what they do

## Key Principles

### 1. Local by Default

Everything a file needs is in the file or clearly imported.

**Good:** Header defines its own links
**Bad:** Header reads links from a config file somewhere else

### 2. One Obvious Place

Each feature has one place to look:
- Auth stuff → `lib/supabase/`
- Payment stuff → `lib/stripe.ts` and `app/api/stripe/`
- Email stuff → `lib/resend.ts`

### 3. Small Files

Short files are easier to understand and modify:
- Pages are mostly layout
- Logic is in lib/ files
- Components do one thing

### 4. DaisyUI Only

All styling uses DaisyUI components. No custom CSS.
- Consistent look
- Easy to modify
- AI knows DaisyUI well

## Rules for AI

When working with Cursor, include these in your prompts:

```
Rules:
- Use DaisyUI components only, no custom CSS
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Keep files small and focused
- Server components unless you need interactivity
- Handle errors gracefully
- Check for TypeScript errors after changes
```

## Prompt Template: Follow Patterns

```
I want to add [NEW FEATURE].

Please:
1. Look at how similar features are built in this codebase
2. Follow the same patterns
3. Keep files small and focused
4. Use DaisyUI for all styling
5. Add proper error handling

Check the codebase first, then implement.
```

## Why This Matters

AI works best with:
- **Predictable code** — Same patterns everywhere
- **Clear structure** — Easy to find things
- **Simple components** — Less to understand

Ghoststack is built this way so Cursor can help you effectively.
