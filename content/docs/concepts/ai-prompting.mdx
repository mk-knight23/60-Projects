# AI Prompting & AGENTS.md

AI coding assistants are only as good as the instructions you give them. This guide covers how to write effective prompts and how `AGENTS.md` keeps the AI aligned with your project's patterns.

The difference between a frustrating AI experience and a productive one often comes down to: (1) being specific about what you want, and (2) giving the AI context about your codebase. Ghoststack's `AGENTS.md` file handles the second part automatically—it tells your AI tool your tech stack, coding conventions, and what to avoid.

## Cursor Modes

Cursor has three modes for different tasks:

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Agent Mode** | Building features, writing code, making changes |
| **Plan Mode** | Thinking through complex tasks before coding |
| **Ask Mode** | Questions about code, no changes needed |

Use **Agent Mode** for most of your work.

> **Claude Code users:** Claude Code doesn't have separate modes — it handles planning and execution fluidly based on your prompts.

## Writing Good Prompts

Keep it simple and clear:

```
I want to add a contact form to my landing page.

It should have:
- Name field
- Email field  
- Message textarea
- Submit button

Send submissions to my email using Resend.
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific about what you want
- `AGENTS.md` is automatically included — no need to reference it
- Mention files if you know them: `@app/page.tsx`

## What is AGENTS.md?

`AGENTS.md` is a file in your project root that tells AI how to write code for *this specific project*. Both Cursor and Claude Code automatically read it with every prompt — you don't need to reference it manually.

It contains:
- Tech stack and versions
- Coding patterns to follow
- File naming conventions
- What to do and what to avoid

Because it's always included, every response from your AI follows your project's conventions automatically.

> **Claude Code users:** Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` by default (same content, different filename). The boilerplate includes both files with identical content.

## Adding External Docs (Cursor)

In Cursor, you can give the AI access to documentation:

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows)
2. Type "Add new custom docs"
3. Add a URL like `https://daisyui.com/llms.txt`

Now use `@docs` in prompts to reference it.

In Claude Code, use `@web URL` in your prompts to fetch external documentation.

## Find Issues Button (Cursor)

After making changes in Cursor, use the **Find Issues** button in the Git tab. It scans your code for problems before you commit.

## Quick Reference

- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` — Automatically included, no need to reference
- `@filename` — Reference a specific file
- `@docs` — Reference added documentation (Cursor)
- `@web URL` — Fetch a webpage for context
